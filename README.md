## Analysis of the GDP per Capita's effect on the World Happiness Score via Python.
# I wanted to take a look at the effects of life factors on the happiness of countries. The Gallup World Poll is used to create the World Happiness Report, which is then used by the United Nations. This data set came from Kaggle, please see below for link. I also received a JSON file from Kaggle as well to help with the global visualization. After analysis was performed, visualizations and a storyboard were made through TableauPublic.
